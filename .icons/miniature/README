This cursor theme is a port from a Windows cursor originally created by Pyro_
You should be able to find the original here (http://customize.org/cursor/50932)

I have never made an X11 cursor theme before so this is probably not perfect.
Likely a mess on the cursor names. However, it works fine on my machine so far.

As always just place the folder in ~/.icons/ or /usr/share/icons/
