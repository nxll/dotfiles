This cursor theme is a port from a Windows cursor originally created by Pyro_
You can find the original here (http://customize.org/cursor/50932)

I have never made an X11 cursor theme before so this may not be perfect.
It works fine on my machine so far however.

As always just place the folder in ~/.icons/ or /usr/share/icons/

Enjoy, nxll
